# AFHTTPRequestOperation Class Reference

Inherits from
[AFURLConnectionOperation][13] : NSOperation

Declared in
AFHTTPRequestOperation.h

## Overview

`AFHTTPRequestOperation` is a subclass of `AFURLConnectionOperation` for requests using the HTTP or HTTPS protocols. It encapsulates the concept of acceptable status codes and content types, which determine the success or failure of a request.

## Tasks

### Getting HTTP URL Connection Information

* `[&nbsp;&nbsp;response][7]` property
* `[&nbsp;&nbsp;responseSerializer][9]` property
* `[&nbsp;&nbsp;responseObject][8]` property

### Setting Completion Block Success / Failure Callbacks

* `[–&nbsp;setCompletionBlockWithSuccess:failure:][11]`

## Properties

### response

The last HTTP response received by the operation's connection.

`@property (readonly, nonatomic, strong) NSHTTPURLResponse *response`

#### Declared In

`AFHTTPRequestOperation.h`


### responseObject

An object constructed by the `responseSerializer` from the response and response data. Returns `nil` unless the operation `isFinished`, has a `response`, and has `responseData` with non-zero content length. If an error occurs during serialization, `nil` will be returned, and the `error` property will be populated with the serialization error.

`@property (readonly, nonatomic, strong) id responseObject`

#### Declared In

`AFHTTPRequestOperation.h`


### responseSerializer

Responses sent from the server in data tasks created with `dataTaskWithRequest:success:failure:` and run using the `GET` / `POST` / et al. convenience methods are automatically validated and serialized by the response serializer. By default, this property is set to an AFHTTPResponse serializer, which uses the raw data as its response object. The serializer validates the status code to be in the `2XX` range, denoting success. If the response serializer generates an error in `-responseObjectForResponse:data:error:`, the `failure` callback of the session task or request operation will be executed; otherwise, the `success` callback will be executed.

`@property (nonatomic, strong) AFHTTPResponseSerializer *responseSerializer`

#### Discussion

Warning: `responseSerializer` must not be `nil`. Setting a response serializer will clear out any cached value

#### Declared In

`AFHTTPRequestOperation.h`


## Instance Methods

### setCompletionBlockWithSuccess:failure:

Sets the `completionBlock` property with a block that executes either the specified success or failure block, depending on the state of the request on completion. If `error` returns a value, which can be caused by an unacceptable status code or content type, then `failure` is executed. Otherwise, `success` is executed.

`\- (void)setCompletionBlockWithSuccess:(void ( ^ ) ( AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation , id responseObject ))success failure:(void ( ^ ) ( AFHTTPRequestOperation *operation , NSError *error ))failure`

#### Parameters

success
:

The block to be executed on the completion of a successful request. This block has no return value and takes two arguments: the receiver operation and the object constructed from the response data of the request.

failure
:

The block to be executed on the completion of an unsuccessful request. This block has no return value and takes two arguments: the receiver operation and the error that occurred during the request.

#### Discussion

This method should be overridden in subclasses in order to specify the response object passed into the success block.

#### Declared In

`AFHTTPRequestOperation.h`
